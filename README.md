This project aims to forecast the future goal statistics of football legends Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo based on historical data from the 2002/03 season to the 2019/20 season. The dataset includes records of goals scored by each player. We employed data manipulation along with time series analysis techniques, including SARIMA and Holt Winterâ€™s Exponential Smoothing models, to make short-term predictions. The report discusses the methodology, model diagnostics, and forecast evaluations.
